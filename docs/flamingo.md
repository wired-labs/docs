Flamingo is an open social protocol used by the Wired. It is a set of smart contracts for building social applications on Ethereum. Flamingo is open for anyone to use, and is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/wired-labs/flamingo).

Flamingo is still early in development, and is subject to change. If you have any questions or features you want to see, please join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/VCsAEneUMn) and let us know!

## üç§ Profile

The profile contract allows anyone to create a profile on the blockchain. Profiles are free-to-mint NFTs, and allow users to store arbitrary data about themselves - such as their name, profile picture, and social media links.

Each profile can set a handle, which is a unique string that can be used to identify the profile. Handles are made up of a string, followed by an assigned number ID. For example, `Alice#1234`. Handles can be changed at any time.

## üìú Deployed Contracts

Contracts are deployed on the Arbitrum Goerli testnet.
