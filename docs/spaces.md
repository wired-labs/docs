A space is a 3D multiplayer environment. Spaces are the core building block of the Wired.

## 🎨 Creation

Spaces are created for free using the visual editor - visit the [thewired.space/create](https://www.thewired.space/create) to create a new project and start building.

Space scenes are stored as [glTF](https://www.khronos.org/gltf/) models. The exciting thing about glTF is that its an open file format supported by many engines. Scenes you create in the editor can be opened in 3D tools like Blender, Unity, and Unreal Engine - or used in other platforms like [Webaverse](https://twitter.com/webaverse).

It also works the other direction - you can create models in powerful tools like Blender, then import them into the editor and use them in your space.

## 🌿 Publishing

Once your scene is ready, you can publish it from the editor as a [Lens Publication](https://docs.lens.xyz/docs/publication). This will make your space available to the world.

## 🏗️ Hosting

Just like websites, spaces need servers to host them.

The host server acts like a traditional game server - it manages player connections to your space, handles communication between them, and acts as as a source of truth for the state of the space.

The team runs a host server that is used by default for spaces created at [thewired.space](https://thewired.space), but you can always change it to your own. Importantly, travel between spaces is not limited to the host server - you can travel between spaces hosted on different servers just like websites. Self-hosting spaces is one of the core principles of the Wired - every layer is open for others to build on.
