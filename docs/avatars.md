You can upload your own VRM avatar to use in the Wired.

## 🤔 What is VRM

[VRM](https://vrm.dev/) is a free and open file format for 3D avatars, supported by many applications. You can create a VRM avatar using the [VRoid Editor](https://vroid.com/editor/en), or export to the `.vrm` file format from blender using [this blender plugin](https://github.com/saturday06/VRM_Addon_for_Blender).

The Wired supports both the VRM 0.0 and 1.0 standards.

## 🌿 Publishing

You can publish an avatar as a [Lens Publication](https://docs.lens.xyz/docs/publication). This will make your avatar available to the world, allowing anyone to use it.

Visit [thewired.space/create](https://www.thewired.space/create) to create a new avatar publication.

## 🚀 Perfomance Ranks

Avatars are categorized into performance ranks, depending on how optimized they are. This is not a perfect system, but it should give you a rough idea of how well an avatar will perform in the Wired.
