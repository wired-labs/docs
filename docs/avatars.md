You can upload your own VRM avatar to use in the Wired.

## ðŸ¤” What is VRM

[VRM](https://vrm.dev/) is a free and open file format for 3D avatars, supported by many applications. You can create a VRM avatar using the [VRoid Editor](https://vroid.com/editor/en), or export to the `.vrm` file format from blender using [this blender plugin](https://github.com/saturday06/VRM_Addon_for_Blender).

The Wired supports both the VRM 0.0 and 1.0 standards.

## ðŸš€ Perfomance Ranks

Avatars are categorized into performance ranks, depending on how optimized they are. This is not a perfect system, but it should give you a rough idea of how well an avatar will perform in the Wired.

Players can automatically block avatars with a low performance rank, so it's important to optimize your avatar.
