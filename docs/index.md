The Wired is an open and decentralized web-based metaverse platform.

The Wired reimagines the web as an **interconnected network of 3D spaces**, instead of 2D pages - all while running on open standards and decentralized infrastructure. You can access the Wired through any browser, on any device.

### ðŸ”¥ Features

- Decentralized identity / social graph using [Lens Protocol ðŸŒ¿](https://lens.dev/)
- Open backend, anyone can run their own servers
- Custom multi-threaded, [glTF](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF)-based game engine
- [VRM](https://vrm.dev/) avatar support
- Visual editor for creating spaces

:::info

Currently, the Wired only supports Lens Protocol on the **Polygon Mumbai Testnet**. You can visit the [Polygon Faucet](https://faucet.polygon.technology/) to get some free testnet MATIC.
